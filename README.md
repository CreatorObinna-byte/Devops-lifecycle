# Foundational DevOps Concepts 

DevOps is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

# Core principles of DevOps includes:

Collaborations:
Breaking down silos between development operations teams, fostering open communication, and shared responsibility.

Automation:
Automating repetitive tasks, such as testing and deployment, to increase speed and efficiency.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery(CI/CD):
Regularly integrating code changes and releasing software updates frequently.

Feedback:
Continuously monitoring performance and gathering feedback to improve the software development process.

Continuous Improvement:
Embracing a culture of learning and adapting to improve processes and outcomes.

# DevOps Lifecycle Stages.

Planning:
This phase involves defining the project's goals, requirements and roadmaps, including gathering feedback and prioritizing tasks.

Development:
This focuses on writing and managing the applications's source code.

Building:
This phase involves, compiling, packaging and preparing the  code for testing and deployment.

Testing:
This phase involves verifying the code's functionality, quality, and security through automated and manual testing.

Release:
This phase prepares the application for deployment, including finalizing configurations and documentation.

Deployment:
This phase involves automating the deployment of the application to various enviromnets, often using tools like CI/CD pipelines.

Operations:
This focuses on managing the application post-deployment, including sever management, monitoring, and maintenance.

Monitoring:
This phase involves tracking the application's performance, identifying issues, and gathering data to improve the system.
